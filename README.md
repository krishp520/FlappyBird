# Flappy Bird (2D)

Flappy Bird is a classic 2D side-scrolling game inspired by the original mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen. In this game, the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without colliding with them.

## Gameplay
- **Objective**: Guide the bird through an infinite series of pipe gaps by tapping the screen or pressing a key to make the bird "flap" and gain altitude.
- **Mechanics**: The bird gradually descends due to gravity, and each "flap" temporarily propels it upward. The player must time their flaps to navigate through the gaps in the pipes.
- **Scoring**: Points are earned for successfully passing through each pair of pipes.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

## Features
- **Side Scrolling**: The game features a continuous scrolling effect that creates an engaging and dynamic environment.
- **Infinite Generation**: The pipes are procedurally generated, ensuring endless gameplay.
- **Parallax Background**: Smoothly scrolling background layers add depth to the 2D game environment.
- **Simple Controls**: Designed for intuitive gameplay, making it accessible to players of all ages.
